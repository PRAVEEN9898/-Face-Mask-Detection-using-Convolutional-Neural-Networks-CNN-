**Project Title: Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

**Description:**

The Face Mask Detection project is a computer vision application developed to identify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful class of deep learning models designed for image processing tasks.

**Real-World Applications:**

1. **Public Health and Safety:** The face mask detection system contributes to public health efforts by automatically monitoring and enforcing face mask compliance in crowded places, such as airports, public transportation, and shopping centers.

2. **Workplace Safety:** In workplaces and industrial settings, the system can be integrated with access control systems to ensure that employees are wearing face masks before entering the premises.

3. **Smart Surveillance:** The technology can be integrated into existing surveillance systems to provide real-time alerts and notifications when individuals are detected without face masks.

4. **Compliance Monitoring:** Government agencies and health organizations can use the system to monitor and enforce face mask regulations, especially during health crises or pandemics.
