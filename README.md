# Face Mask Detection Project

## Overview

The Face Mask Detection Project is an innovative application designed to identify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It contributes to public health and safety efforts by automating the monitoring of face mask compliance in various settings.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** The model employs Convolutional Neural Networks to accurately classify images and determine whether a person is wearing a face mask.
- **Real-Time Detection:** The system provides real-time detection, making it suitable for applications where immediate alerts are necessary.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset consisting of images with and without face masks, achieving a high accuracy rate of 98%.

## Uses in Real World

1. **Public Health Monitoring:** The project supports public health initiatives by automating face mask compliance monitoring in crowded places, such as airports, public transportation, and shopping centers.
2. **Workplace Safety:** In workplaces and industrial settings, the system can be integrated with access control systems to ensure that employees are wearing face masks before entering the premises.
3. **Smart Surveillance:** Integrated into existing surveillance systems, the technology provides real-time alerts when individuals are detected without face masks.
4. **Compliance Enforcement:** Government agencies and health organizations can use the system to monitor and enforce face mask regulations, especially during health crises or pandemics.

## Conclusion

The Face Mask Detection Project showcases the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks in addressing real-world challenges. Its applications in public health and safety underscore its importance in promoting responsible practices during health crises.
